# How to use this Repo:

## Prerequisites:

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured with access to Amazon Bedrock.

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.11 or greater. The POC runs on python. 



## Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/genai-quickstart-pocs.git
    ```
    
    The file structure of this POC is broken into these files
    
    * `requirements.txt` - all the requirements needed to get the sample application up and running.
    * `app.py` - The streamlit frontend
    
    
    * `pdf_image_alt_text_generator/generator.py` - The is the logic that extracts the data from PDF and calls the Bedrock Model for inference
    
    * `pdf_image_alt_text_generator/download_results.py` - generates a PDF with all images and their alt text results, as well as input/output token usage, calculated in a table.
    
    

1. Open the repository in your favorite code editor. In the terminal, navigate to the POC's folder:
    ```zsh
    cd genai-quickstart-pocs-python/amazon-bedrock-alt-text-generator
    ```

1. Configure the python virtual environment, activate it & install project dependencies. *Note: each POC has it's own dependencies & dependency management.*
    ```zsh
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Start the POC from your terminal
    ```zsh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
This should start the POC and open a browser window to the application.
