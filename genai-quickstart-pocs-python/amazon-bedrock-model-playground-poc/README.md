# Amazon Bedrock Model Playground POC

## Overview of Solution

This is sample code demonstrating the use of Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI to implement a Gen AI model playground. The application is constructed with a simple streamlit frontend where users can input zero shot requests and select any LLM offered by Amazon Bedrock.

## Goal of this POC
The goal of this repo is to provide users the ability to use Amazon Bedrock and select any of the available Amazon Bedrock LLMs to ask zero shot requests.
This repo comes with a basic frontend to help users stand up a proof of concept in just a few minutes.

The architecture & flow of the POC is as follows:
![POC Architecture & Flow](images/architecture.png 'POC Architecture')


When a user interacts with the POC, the flow is as follows:

1. The user selects the Amazon Bedrock Model they want to use and makes a &quot;zero-shot&quot; request to the streamlit frontend. (`app.py`).

1. The application takes the question and the model chosen and routes it to the appropriate model (`model_invoker.py`). All specific model invocations are stored in (model_selector.py).

1. The final answer is generated by the Amazon Bedrock Model chosen and displayed on the frontend application (`app.py`).




# How to use this Repo:

## Prerequisites:

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured with access to Amazon Bedrock.

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.11 or greater. The POC runs on python. 



## Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/genai-quickstart-pocs.git
    ```
    
    The file structure of this POC is broken into these files
    
    * `requirements.txt` - all the requirements needed to get the sample application up and running.
    * `app.py` - The streamlit frontend
    
    
    * `model_invoker.py` - This file has the logic to interact with LLM using Amazon Bedrock API. 
    
    * `model_selector.py` - This is the file that contains the logic to map the model selected by the user to the appropriate Amazon Bedrock Model.
    
    

1. Open the repository in your favorite code editor. In the terminal, navigate to the POC's folder:
    ```zsh
    cd genai-quickstart-pocs-python/amazon-bedrock-model-playground-poc
    ```

1. Configure the python virtual environment, activate it & install project dependencies. *Note: each POC has it's own dependencies & dependency management.*
    ```zsh
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. reate a .env file in the root of this POC specific directory within this repo. Within the .env file you just created you will need to configure the .env to contain:

    ```zsh
    profile_name=<AWS_CLI_PROFILE_NAME>
region_name=us-east-1 (region of choice)
    ```


1. Start the POC from your terminal
    ```zsh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
This should start the POC and open a browser window to the application.
