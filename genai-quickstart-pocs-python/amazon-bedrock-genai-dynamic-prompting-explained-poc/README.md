# Amazon Bedrock GenAI Dynamic Prompt Explained POC

## Overview of Solution

This is sample code that can be used to provide a hands on explanation as to how Dynamic Prompting works in relation to Gen AI. The application is constructed with a simple streamlit frontend where users can ask questions against a Amazon Bedrock supported LLM and get a deeper understanding of how few-shot and dynamic prompting works.

## Goal of this POC
The goal of this repo is to provide users the ability to use Amazon Bedrock in a similar fashion to ChatGPT, in this case
the application has a strong focus on demonstrating on how prompts are dynamically selected based on the user inputted question.
This repo comes with a basic frontend to help users stand up a proof of concept in just a few minutes.

The architecture & flow of the POC is as follows:
![POC Architecture & Flow](images/architecture.png 'POC Architecture')


When a user interacts with the POC, the flow is as follows:

1. The user makes a &quot;zero-shot&quot; request to the streamlit frontend. (app.py`)

1. The application performs a semantic search of the users query against the 1200+ prompts. (`prompt_finder_and_invoke_llm.py`)

1. The application returns the 3 most semantically similar prompts, and creates a final prompt that contains the 3 returned prompts along with users query (few-shot prompting) (`prompt_finder_and_invoke_llm.py`)

1. The final prompt is passed into Amazon Bedrock to generate an answer to the users question (`prompt_finder_and_invoke_llm.py`)

1. The final answer is generated by Amazon Bedrock and displayed on the frontend application along with 3 most semantically similar prompts (`app.py`)




# How to use this Repo:

## Prerequisites:

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured with access to Amazon Bedrock.

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.11 or greater. The POC runs on python. 



## Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/genai-quickstart-pocs.git
    ```
    
    The file structure of this POC is broken into these files
    
    * `requirements.txt` - all the requirements needed to get the sample application up and running.
    * `app.py` - The streamlit frontend
    
    
    * `prompt_finder_and_invoke_llm.py` - Houses the logic of the application, including the prompt formatting logic and Amazon Bedrock API invocations.
    
    

1. Open the repository in your favorite code editor. In the terminal, navigate to the POC's folder:
    ```zsh
    cd genai-quickstart-pocs-python/amazon-bedrock-genai-dynamic-prompting-explained-poc
    ```

1. Configure the python virtual environment, activate it & install project dependencies. *Note: each POC has it's own dependencies & dependency management.*
    ```zsh
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. create a .env file in the root of this repo. Within the .env file you just created you will need to configure the .env to contain:

    ```zsh
    profile_name=<AWS_CLI_PROFILE_NAME>
    ```


1. Depending on the region and model that you are planning to use Amazon Bedrock in, you may need to reconfigure line 12 in the prompt_finder_and_invoke_llm.py file to set the appropriate region:

    ```zsh
    bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', 'us-east-1', endpoint_url='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
    ```


1. Start the POC from your terminal
    ```zsh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
This should start the POC and open a browser window to the application.
