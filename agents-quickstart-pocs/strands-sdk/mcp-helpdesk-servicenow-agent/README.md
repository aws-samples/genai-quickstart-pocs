## Overview

MCP ServiceNow Helpdesk Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot for ServiceNow incident management, built with [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It connects directly to a ServiceNow MCP server, dynamically discovers all available tools, and passes them to a Strands Agent for natural language ITSM support.

---

## What are Strands Agents?

[Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/) is an open-source, model-driven framework for building intelligent, autonomous agents. It allows developers to:
- Integrate large language models (LLMs) with external tools and APIs
- Orchestrate complex workflows and multi-step reasoning
- Build agents that can plan, reason, and act autonomously
- Support multi-agent collaboration and advanced tool use

Strands Agents provides a simple, code-first interface for connecting LLMs to real-world actions, making it ideal for enterprise automation and AI-driven assistants.
