    User["User (Web/CLI)"]
    Streamlit["Streamlit UI"]
    Agent["Strands Agent"]
    Tools["ServiceNow MCP Tools Wrapper"]
    MCP["ServiceNow MCP Server"]
    ServiceNow["ServiceNow Platform"]

    User --> Streamlit
    Streamlit --> Agent
    Agent --> Tools
    Tools --> MCP
    MCP --> ServiceNow
    Tools -- "Results/Incidents/Knowledge" --> Agent
    Agent -- "Response" --> Streamlit
    Streamlit -- "Chat/Incident Actions" --> User
```

**Flow:**
- The user interacts with the chatbot via a web (Streamlit) or CLI interface.
- The UI sends user queries to the Strands Agent.
- The agent uses the ServiceNow MCP Tools Wrapper to perform actions (create/search/update incidents, etc.).
- The tools communicate with the ServiceNow MCP Server, which in turn interacts with the ServiceNow Platform.
- Results are returned back up the chain to the user.

## üîß Configuration

```python

    "env": {
        "SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL": "https://your-instance.service-now.com",

        "SERVICENOW_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SERVICENOW_AUTH_TYPE": "basic"
