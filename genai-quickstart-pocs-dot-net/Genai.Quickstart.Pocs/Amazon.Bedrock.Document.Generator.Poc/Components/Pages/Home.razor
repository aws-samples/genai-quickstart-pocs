<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" GutterBottom="true">
    If you're exploring the features of .NET 8 Blazor,<br /> you might be pleasantly surprised to learn that each page is prerendered on the server,<br /> regardless of the selected render mode.<br /><br />
    This means that you'll need to inject all necessary services on the server,<br /> even when opting for the wasm (WebAssembly) render mode.<br /><br />
    This prerendering functionality is crucial to ensuring that WebAssembly mode feels fast and responsive,<br /> especially when it comes to initial page load times.<br /><br />
    For more information on how to detect prerendering and leverage the RenderContext, you can refer to the following link:
