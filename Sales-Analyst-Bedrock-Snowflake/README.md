# Amazon Bedrock & Snowflake Sales Analyst POC (Text to SQL)

## Overview of Solution

This is sample code demonstrating the use of Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI to create an intelligent sales data analyst that uses natural language questions to query relational data stores, specifically Snowflake. This example leverages the complete Northwind sample database with realistic sales scenarios containing customers, orders, and order details.

## Goal of this POC
The goal of this repo is to provide users the ability to use Amazon Bedrock and generative AI to ask natural language questions about sales performance, customer behavior, and business metrics. These questions are automatically transformed into optimized SQL queries against a Snowflake database. This repo includes intelligent context retrieval using FAISS vector store, LangGraph workflow orchestration, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

The architecture & flow of the POC is as follows:
![POC Architecture & Flow](images/architecture.png 'POC Architecture')

When a user interacts with the POC, the flow is as follows:

1. **Natural Language Query**: The user makes a request through the Streamlit interface, asking a natural language question about sales data in Snowflake (`app.py`)

2. **Query Understanding**: The natural language question is passed to Amazon Bedrock for intent analysis and query classification (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

3. **Context Retrieval**: The system performs semantic search using FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant database schema information and table relationships (`src/vector_store/faiss_manager.py`)

4. **Intelligent SQL Generation**: Amazon Bedrock generates optimized SQL queries using the retrieved context, ensuring proper table joins and data type handling (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

5. **Secure Query Execution**: The SQL query is executed against the Snowflake database through secure connection (`src/utils/snowflake_connector.py`)

6. **Result Analysis**: The retrieved data is passed back to Amazon Bedrock for intelligent analysis and insight generation (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

7. **Natural Language Response**: The system returns comprehensive insights and explanations to the user through the Streamlit frontend (`app.py`)

3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor. In the terminal, navigate to the POC's folder:
    ```bash
    cd Sales-Analyst-Bedrock-Snowflake
    ```

4. Configure the Python virtual environment, activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Configure your credentials by editing the `.env` file and replacing the dummy values with your actual credentials:

    ```bash
    # AWS Configuration (Required)
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here

    # Snowflake Configuration (Required)
    SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account_identifier
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
    SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your_role
    ```

7. Start the application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

8. **Automatic Setup**: On first run, the application will automatically:
   - Connect to your Snowflake account
   - Check if Northwind sample database exists
   - Download Northwind sample data if needed
   - Create `SALES_ANALYST` database and `NORTHWIND` schema
   - Load complete sample dataset (8 tables with sales data)
   - Build vector store with schema metadata
   - This process takes approximately 2-3 minutes

9. **Start Analyzing**: Once setup is complete, you can ask natural language questions like:
   - "What are the top 5 customers by order value?"
   - "Show me the schema of the CUSTOMERS table"
   - "Count the number of orders by country"
   - "What's the distribution of order priorities?"
   - "What's the average order value by customer?"
   - "Which products are most popular?"
