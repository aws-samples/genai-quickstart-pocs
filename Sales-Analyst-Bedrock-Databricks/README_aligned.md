# Amazon Bedrock & Databricks Sales Analyst POC (Text to SQL)

## Overview of Solution

This is sample code demonstrating the use of Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI to create an intelligent sales data analyst that uses natural language questions to query relational data stores, specifically Databricks. This example leverages the complete Northwind sample database with realistic sales scenarios containing customers, orders, and order details.

## Goal of this POC
The goal of this repo is to provide users the ability to use Amazon Bedrock and generative AI to ask natural language questions about sales performance, customer behavior, and business metrics. These questions are automatically transformed into optimized SQL queries against a Databricks workspace. This repo includes intelligent context retrieval using FAISS vector store, LangGraph workflow orchestration, and complete Databricks automation.

The architecture & flow of the POC is as follows:
![POC Architecture & Flow](images/architecture.png 'POC Architecture')

When a user interacts with the POC, the flow is as follows:

1. **Natural Language Query**: The user makes a request through the Streamlit interface, asking a natural language question about sales data in Databricks (`app.py`)

2. **Query Understanding**: The natural language question is passed to Amazon Bedrock for intent analysis and query classification (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

3. **Context Retrieval**: The system performs semantic search using FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant database schema information and table relationships (`src/vector_store/faiss_manager.py`)

4. **Intelligent SQL Generation**: Amazon Bedrock generates optimized SQL queries using the retrieved context, ensuring proper table joins and data type handling (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

5. **Secure Query Execution**: The SQL query is executed against the Databricks workspace through secure REST API connection (`src/utils/databricks_rest_connector.py`)

6. **Result Analysis**: The retrieved data is passed back to Amazon Bedrock for intelligent analysis and insight generation (`src/graph/workflow.py`)

7. **Natural Language Response**: The system returns comprehensive insights and explanations to the user through the Streamlit frontend (`app.py`)

3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor. In the terminal, navigate to the POC's folder:
    ```bash
    cd Sales-Analyst-Bedrock-Databricks
    ```

4. Configure the Python virtual environment, activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Configure your credentials by editing the `.env` file and replacing the dummy values with your actual credentials:

    ```bash
    # AWS Configuration (Required)
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here

    # Databricks Configuration (Auto-configured)
    DATABRICKS_HOST=localhost
    DATABRICKS_TOKEN=auto_generated
    DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_ID=auto_created
    DATABRICKS_CATALOG=sales_analyst
    DATABRICKS_SCHEMA=northwind
    ```

7. Start the application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

8. **Automatic Setup**: On first run, the application will automatically:
   - Create Databricks workspace (if needed)
   - Launch serverless SQL warehouse with optimized configuration
   - Download complete Northwind dataset from GitHub (91 customers, 830 orders, 2155 order details)
   - Load data with proper relationships and foreign keys
   - Initialize AI components and vector store
   - This process takes approximately 5-8 minutes

9. **Start Analyzing**: Once setup is complete, you can ask natural language questions like:
   - "What are the top 5 customers by order value?"
   - "Which customers haven't placed orders recently?"
   - "Show me customer distribution by country"
   - "What's the average order value by customer?"
   - "Which products are most popular?"
   - "Show me sales trends by month"
