            A commit was pushed to \`main\` that failed security scanning AND modifies workflow files.
            
            **⚠️ GitHub Actions cannot automatically revert commits that modify workflow files.**
            
            ### 📋 Commit Details
            
            - **SHA:** \`${commitSha}\` ([view commit](${context.payload.repository.html_url}/commit/${commitSha}))
            - **Author:** @${commitAuthor}
            - **Message:** ${commitMsg}
            - **Security Scan:** [View failed workflow](${context.payload.workflow_run.html_url})
            
            ### 🔍 Security Issues Found
            
            The commit failed the Bandit security scan with HIGH or MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities.
            
            ### ⚠️ Workflow Files Modified
            
            This commit modifies files in \`.github/workflows/\` which GitHub Actions cannot automatically revert due to security restrictions.
            
            ### ✅ Manual Revert Required
            
            **Someone with write access must manually revert this commit:**
            
            \`\`\`bash
            # Checkout main branch
            git checkout main
            git pull
            
            # Revert the commit
            git revert ${commitSha}
            
            # Create a branch
            git checkout -b revert-${shortSha}
            
            # Push and create PR
            git push origin revert-${shortSha}
            \`\`\`
            
            Then create a Pull Request from \`revert-${shortSha}\` to \`main\`.
            
            ### 🛡️ Prevention
            
            - Never push directly to \`main\` branch
            - Always use Pull Requests
            - Wait for security scans to pass before merging

          ### ✅ Next Steps
          
          1. **Review this PR** - Verify the revert is correct
          2. **Merge this PR** - Remove vulnerable code from main
          3. **Fix the issues** - Create a new PR with security fixes
          4. **Prevent recurrence** - Always use PRs, never push directly to main
          
          ---
          
          ### 🛡️ Prevention
          
          This happened because code was pushed directly to \`main\` branch.
          
          **To prevent this:**
          - ✅ Always create Pull Requests
          - ✅ Wait for security scans to pass
          - ✅ Never push directly to protected branches
          - ✅ Review branch protection settings

          ### Actions Taken
          - ✅ Revert PR created automatically
          - ⏳ Waiting for review and merge
          
          ### What Happened
          1. Commit was pushed directly to \`main\` branch (bypassing PR process)
          2. Bandit security scan detected HIGH or MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities
          3. Automatic revert PR was created to remove vulnerable code
          
          ### Next Steps
          1. **Review and merge the revert PR** to remove vulnerable code
          2. **Review security scan results:** [View Workflow](${context.payload.workflow_run.html_url})
          3. **Fix the security issues** in a feature branch
          4. **Create a new PR** with the fixes
          5. **Ensure security scan passes** before merging
          
          ### Prevention
          - Always use Pull Requests instead of direct pushes to \`main\`
          - Wait for all checks to pass before merging
          - Review branch protection settings if this happens frequently
          
          @${commitAuthor} - Please review the security issues and create a fix.
