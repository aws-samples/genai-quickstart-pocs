## Communication Patterns

### Message Passing System

The agents communicate through a structured message passing system that ensures reliable, traceable communication.

**Message Structure**:
```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  id: string;
  sender: AgentType;
  recipient: AgentType | 'broadcast';
  messageType: 'request' | 'response' | 'update' | 'error';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  content: {
    task?: TaskDefinition;
    data?: any;
    results?: AnalysisResults;
    error?: ErrorDetails;
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date;
    conversationId: string;
    requestId: string;
    parentMessageId?: string;
    expectedResponseTime?: number;
  };
}
```

### Communication Patterns

#### 1. Direct Request-Response
Used for specific task assignments and result delivery.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Supervisor
    participant R as Research Agent
    
    S->>R: Research Request
    Note over R: Process Request
    R->>S: Research Results
    Note over S: Process Results
```

#### 2. Broadcast Notifications
Used for system-wide updates and status changes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Supervisor
    participant R as Research Agent
    participant A as Analysis Agent
    participant C as Compliance Agent
    
    S->>R: Broadcast: Priority Change
    S->>A: Broadcast: Priority Change
    S->>C: Broadcast: Priority Change
```

#### 3. Chain of Responsibility
Used for sequential processing where each agent builds on previous results.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Supervisor
    participant R as Research Agent
    participant A as Analysis Agent
    participant Sy as Synthesis Agent
    
    S->>R: Initial Research
    R->>A: Research Data
    A->>Sy: Analysis Results
    Sy->>S: Final Report
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Plan-and-Execute Pattern

Used for complex, multi-step analyses requiring careful coordination.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Supervisor Agent]
    B --> C[Planning Agent]
    C --> D[Create Detailed Plan]
    D --> E[Task Assignment]
    E --> F[Research Agent]
    E --> G[Analysis Agent]
    E --> H[Compliance Agent]
    F --> I[Synthesis Agent]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J[Final Report]
    J --> B
    B --> K[User Response]
```

**Execution Flow**:
1. Supervisor receives and analyzes user request
2. Planning Agent creates detailed execution plan
3. Tasks are assigned to specialized agents in sequence
4. Each agent completes its assigned tasks
5. Synthesis Agent integrates all results
6. Supervisor reviews and delivers final response

### 2. Reactive Agent Pattern

Used for exploratory research and dynamic analysis scenarios.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Supervisor Agent]
    B --> C[Initial Research]
    C --> D{New Information?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Trigger Additional Analysis]
    D -->|No| F[Compile Results]
    E --> G[Specialized Agent Processing]
    G --> D
    F --> H[Synthesis]
    H --> I[Final Response]
```

**Execution Flow**:
1. Supervisor initiates research based on user query
2. Research Agent begins information gathering
3. As new information is discovered, additional agents are triggered
4. Agents operate semi-autonomously with supervisor oversight
5. Results are continuously integrated and refined
6. Final synthesis occurs when all relevant information is gathered

## Agent Coordination Mechanisms

### Task Queue Management

Each agent maintains a priority-based task queue:

```typescript
interface TaskQueue {
  high: Task[];
  medium: Task[];
  low: Task[];
  
  enqueue(task: Task, priority: Priority): void;
  dequeue(): Task | null;
  peek(): Task | null;
  size(): number;
}
```

### Context Sharing

Agents share context through a centralized context store:

```typescript
interface SharedContext {
  conversationId: string;
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  currentAnalysis: AnalysisContext;
  historicalData: HistoricalContext;
  
  updateContext(key: string, value: any): void;
  getContext(key: string): any;
  clearContext(): void;
}
```

### Conflict Resolution

When agents produce conflicting results, the Supervisor Agent employs several resolution strategies:

1. **Confidence-Based Resolution**: Higher confidence results take precedence
2. **Source Credibility**: Results from more credible sources are preferred
3. **Consensus Building**: Multiple agents vote on the best approach
4. **Human Escalation**: Complex conflicts are escalated to human reviewers

### Error Handling and Recovery

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
interface ErrorHandling {
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
  fallbackStrategies: FallbackStrategy[];
  escalationRules: EscalationRule[];
  
  handleError(error: AgentError): Promise<ErrorResolution>;
  implementFallback(strategy: FallbackStrategy): Promise<void>;
  escalateToHuman(issue: EscalationIssue): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Load Balancing

Tasks are distributed across agents based on:
- Current workload
- Agent specialization
- Task complexity
- Response time requirements

### Caching Strategy

Results are cached at multiple levels:
- Agent-level caching for repeated queries
- Shared cache for common research topics
- User-specific cache for personalized results

### Parallel Processing

Where possible, agents work in parallel:
- Research and compliance checks run simultaneously
- Multiple analysis types execute concurrently
- Synthesis begins as soon as sufficient data is available

## Monitoring and Observability

### Agent Performance Metrics

Each agent tracks:
- Task completion time
- Success/failure rates
- Resource utilization
- Quality scores

### System-Level Metrics

The orchestration system monitors:
- End-to-end request processing time
- Agent coordination efficiency
- Error rates and recovery success
- User satisfaction scores

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

The system provides:
- Detailed execution traces
- Agent communication logs
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error root cause analysis

## Security and Compliance

### Access Control

Each agent operates with minimal required permissions:
- Research Agent: Read access to data sources
- Analysis Agent: Compute access only
- Compliance Agent: Read access to regulatory databases
- Synthesis Agent: Write access to output storage

### Data Privacy

Sensitive data handling:
- PII is masked in agent communications
- Proprietary data access is logged and audited
- Results are sanitized before storage

### Audit Trail

Complete audit trail includes:
- All agent communications
- Decision points and rationale
- Data sources accessed
- Results generated and modified

This multi-agent architecture enables the Investment AI Agent to handle complex investment analysis tasks while maintaining high performance, reliability, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
