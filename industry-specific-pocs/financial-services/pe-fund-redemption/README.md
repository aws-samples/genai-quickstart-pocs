## **Introduction**

This POC demonstrates how to enhance a [Strands AgentCore React starter template](https://github.com/altanalytics/strands-agentcore-react) with custom tools and capabilities for a specific finance use case. 

**Key Enhancements Demonstrated:**
- Custom tools in [Strands-Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)
- AgentCore Gateway integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Knowledge base integration for document analysis
- Dual tool architecture (strands-agents + MCP tools)

**Note:** There are no instructions to replicate this POC because it is a complete implementation requiring Aurora database and S3 document storage (fake sample data provided in `/data` folder). 

# Private Equity Fund Redemption AI Assistant

This is a proof-of-concept agentic AI system that revolutionizes Private Equity fund redemption analysis by automating the complex process of investment eligibility verification and redemption request processing.

## Business Use Case

### The Problem
Private Equity fund redemption reviews are traditionally time-intensive manual processes requiring deep expertise:
- **Hours per analysis**: Each redemption request requires identifying a specific investment to redeem and then an extensive review of the fund document, investor eligibility, fund eligibility and specific investment eligibility. 
- **High volume**: Fund managers typically process 30+ redemption requests monthly across diverse fund portfolios
- **Complex compliance matrix**: Multiple variables must be cross-referenced:
  - **Investor class tiers** (ClassA, ClassB, Institutional) with different terms and restrictions
  - **Holding period requirements** (30-39+ months minimum depending on fund and class)
  - **Redemption windows** (quarterly gates with specific notice periods: 45-105 days)
  - **Fee structures** (early/mid/late redemption fees: 0-3% based on timing)
  - **Volume restrictions** (minimum redemption percentages, annual caps, quarterly gates)
  - **Market conditions** (stress deferrals, valuation thresholds)
- **Multi-source data reconciliation**: Investment records, fund documents, investor profiles, and historical redemption patterns
- **Human error risk**: Manual cross-referencing of complex rules increases oversight probability

### The Solution
This AI-powered system transforms redemption analysis from hours to minutes by:
- **Intelligent investment discovery**: Guides users to identify investments eligible for redemption
- **Document-driven analysis**: Retrieves and processes actual fund documents with redemption criteria
- **Automated eligibility verification**: AI agent analyzes fund documents and applies redemption rules contextually
- **Structured decision support**: Provides detailed reasoning and recommendations for redemption requests

### Value Proposition
- **Time savings**: Reduces analysis time from hours to minutes per request
- **Accuracy improvement**: Eliminates human error through systematic rule application
- **Scalability**: Handles high-volume redemption processing efficiently
- **Compliance assurance**: Ensures all fund document requirements are properly evaluated

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview
This application combines a modern React frontend with an AI-powered backend leveraging the latest LLM models on Amazon Bedrock and hosted on AgentCore (still in preview).

### Architecture Components

#### **Frontend Layer**
- **React Application**: Modern, responsive chat interface for user interactions
- **AWS Amplify Hosting**: Scalable web hosting with CI/CD integration
- **Cognito Authentication**: Secure user authentication with email/password
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live AI response streaming for enhanced user experience

#### **AI Agent Layer**
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: Orchestrates AI agent runtime and tool execution
- **Strands Agent Framework**: Provides structured agent configuration and conversation management
- **User Model Selection**: For flexibility
- **Dual Tool Architecture**: This POC demonstrates the use of both local tools and MCP-based Lambda tools to show the latest capabilities of Bedrock and [Strands-Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)

#### **Data & Integration Layer**
- **Aurora Database**: Stores structured fund, investment, and investor data
- **S3 Document Storage**: Houses fund documents with redemption rules and criteria
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for database queries and document retrieval
- **MCP Gateway**: Model Context Protocol integration for external tool connectivity

### Tool Ecosystem

#### **Local Agent Tools**
Embedded directly in the AI agent for fast execution:
- `pull_fund_document`: Retrieves fund documents from S3 storage
- `query_database`: Accesses Aurora database for investment and investor data
- `get_investments`: Filters and searches investment records
- `get_investors`: Manages investor information and classifications
- `get_redemption_requests`: Tracks redemption request history

#### **MCP-Based Tools**
Deployed as Lambda functions and accessed via AgentCore Gateway to demonstrate new MCP capabilities:
- **Database Query Service**: Serverless SQL query
- **Fund Document Service**: Document retrieval and processing from S3 with error handling
- **Advanced Analytics**: Complex redemption rule evaluation and cross-validation

This dual approach showcases both traditional embedded tools and the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration capabilities of AgentCore, providing flexibility in tool deployment and execution patterns.

## Project Foundation

This project is built upon the [Strands AgentCore React](https://github.com/altanalytics/strands-agentcore-react) starter template, enhanced with:
- Custom PE-specific AI agent personalities and prompts
- Comprehensive tool ecosystem for fund data access
- Advanced redemption analysis workflows
- Production-ready AWS infrastructure integration
- Sample data for demonstration purposes


## Agent Personalities

## Example Workflow

### **Typical Redemption Analysis Process**

1. **Investor Discovery**
   - User: "I need to process a redemption for Susan"
   - System: Returns list of all investors named Susan with IDs and details

2. **Investor Selection & Fund Discovery**
   - User: Selects specific Susan (e.g., "Susan Johnson, ID: CA_1234")
   - System: Queries database and returns list of all funds Susan has invested in

3. **Fund Selection & Document Analysis**
   - User: Selects target fund (e.g., "Strategic Growth Fund 1")
   - System: Automatically retrieves fund document for Susan's investor class
   - System: Displays Susan's specific investments in that fund

4. **Investment Analysis & Redemption Eligibility**
   - User: Selects specific investment to redeem
   - System: Cross-references investment data with fund document rules
   - System: Analyzes holding periods, notice requirements, fees, and restrictions
   - System: Provides detailed eligibility assessment with supporting reasons

5. **Redemption Processing**
   - If eligible: System asks "Would you like to process this redemption request?"
   - If ineligible: System explains specific reasons and requirements not met
   - User: Confirms to initiate redemption or requests alternative analysis

This guided workflow ensures comprehensive analysis while maintaining audit trails and regulatory compliance.
