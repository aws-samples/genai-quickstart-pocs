# Private Equity Fund Redemption AI Assistant

This is a proof-of-concept agentic AI system that revolutionizes Private Equity fund redemption analysis by automating the complex process of investment eligibility verification and redemption request processing.

**ðŸš€ Live Demo**: [https://pe.tonytrev.people.aws.dev/](https://pe.tonytrev.people.aws.dev/)  
*Note: For security, only Amazon employees can create accounts*

**Note:** In this implementation, the data will be stored to an S3 document storage (sample data provided in `/data` folder). 


## Steps to Create

### **1. Create the Amplify App**

The skeleton of this app with full steps can be found [here](https://github.com/altanalytics/strands-agentcore-react/tree/main).

Once you have pushed this repo to a hosted repository: 

1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) in us-east-1
2. Click "Deploy an App" or "Create New App" if you already have apps
3. Select your remote git repository to link Amplify to git
4. Choose the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`)
5. Click Next and then in Advanced Settings, add two environment variables:
  - `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN` = `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:123456789012:runtime/strands_agent_xyz` 
    * You will get the real one after step 5, but use this placeholder for now before deployment
  - `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` = `your-email@example.com`
6. Once you deploy your application
7. You can login to your app throught he URL, but your Agent will not work
8. Activate the Amazon Bedrock Nova models (Micro, Pro, Premium) in your AWS account (region us-east-1)
9. *You must also enable the Claude Sonnet 4 model - even though we are invoking Nova-Micro - Strands needs the claude model to be enabled to work (this could change in later versions of `strands-agents`*

*Pay close attention to the environment variables - these have to be set before you deploy*

### **2. Build and Test Your agent and Docker container**

```bash
cd genai

# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Test locally - IMPORTANT: Set environment variable for Strands compatibility
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

uv run uvicorn agent:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is artificial intelligence?"}'
```



```bash
# Setup Docker buildx (make sure Docker desktop is running)
cd genai
docker buildx create --use

# Build image
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t my-agent:arm64 --load .

# Test locally with credentials
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -p 8080:8080 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -e AWS_REGION="$AWS_REGION" \
  my-agent:arm64

# OR Test with credentials file based on a profile
aws configure export-credentials --profile your-profile-name --format env-no-export > docker.env
echo "AWS_REGION=us-east-1" >> docker.env
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file docker.env my-agent:arm64

# Use same test command as above but with input paramters
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "prompt": "Tell me a story",
      "model": "us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0",
      "personality": "You are a storyteller who speaks in the style of Shakespeare."
  }'
```

### **3. Build and Push Docker Image**
```bash

# Set your AWS account ID as a variable
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
AWS_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text --profile $AWS_PROFILE)

# Create ECR repository - only run this one time
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-strands-agent --region us-east-1 --profile $AWS_PROFILE


# Login to ECR using the variable
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile $AWS_PROFILE | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 

# Push to ECR using the variable
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t $AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-strands-agent:latest --push .
```

### **4. Deploy Agent Runtime**
```bash
# Deploy to Bedrock Agent Core
# *** MAKE SURE THE AMPLIFY APP HAS BEEN DEPLOYED AND THE bedrock-agent-core-role OR THIS WILL FAIL
uv run agent_deploy.py

# You can update your existing agent (don't forget to rebuild and push your docker container)
uv run agent_update.py

```

The command above will output "Agent Runtime ARN". You will need this value for the next set of steps. 

### **5. Update Environment Variables**

First update the environment variables in Amplify

1. Go into the AWS UI Console
2. Go to Amplify > App > Hosting > Environment Variables
3. Update the AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN (set up above) with the new runtime

Next configure env variables lovally.  
1. Open the .env.example file in the top folder
2. Update the ARN with the new ARN and save as .env (not as .env.example!!)


### **6. Test Agent**
```bash
# Test your deployed agent
uv run agent_invoke.py
```

## **Creating MCP Server**

If you have made it this far, it is now time to add an additional optional feature. Configuring your tools to run as a unified MCP service. To do this, we setup a single Lambda function that handles all data operations and is available as a standalone tool for other Agents to use.

**New Two-Tool Architecture**: We've moved from a single unified tool to two specialized MCP services - one for fund documents and one for data operations - providing cleaner separation of concerns.

Lets get Started...

### **1. Create a Knowledge Base**

Log into the AWS console. Head to Bedrock > Knowledge Bases. 
* Create a Knowledge Base using Vector Store
* Select Fund Document Folder from your S3 bucket
* Use Titan Embedding model v2
* Select S3 vectors
* Select only the fund_documents folder and not the database folder

Once the Knowledge Base is created (don't forget to sync it) update `genai/tools/knowledge_base___retrieve_documents.py` with your knowledge base id.

### **2. Deploy MCP Services**

Follow the instructions in the MCP configuration README:

```bash
# Navigate to genai directory for uv commands
cd genai

# Deploy Lambda functions (auto-discovers S3 bucket)
uv run ../agent_core_config/deploy_lambdas.py

# Create MCP Gateway with two targets
uv run ../agent_core_config/gateway_deploy.py
# OR
uv run ../agent_core_config/gateway_update.py

# Test the deployment
uv run ../agent_core_config/test_mcp_gateway.py
```

For detailed instructions, see: `agent_core_config/README.md`

### **3. Update Agent with Knowledge Base**

Once the Knowledge Base and MCP services are deployed, update your agent:

```bash
uv run agent_update.py
```

After this, you should be able to log into your website (check amplify for URL).

* You will get an email saying you have a new sign-up (must have amazon.com domain)
* You will have three agents to choose from: Analyst, PE Fund Redemption, or MCP PE Fund Redemption

Enjoy!

# An overview of the app business use case and technical setup

## Business Use Case

### The Problem
Private Equity fund redemption reviews are traditionally time-intensive manual processes requiring deep expertise:
- **Hours per analysis**: Each redemption request requires identifying a specific investment to redeem and then an extensive review of the fund document, investor eligibility, fund eligibility and specific investment eligibility. 
- **High volume**: Fund managers typically process 30+ redemption requests monthly across diverse fund portfolios
- **Complex compliance matrix**: Multiple variables must be cross-referenced:
  - **Investor class tiers** (ClassA, ClassB, Institutional) with different terms and restrictions
  - **Holding period requirements** (30-39+ months minimum depending on fund and class)
  - **Redemption windows** (quarterly gates with specific notice periods: 45-105 days)
  - **Fee structures** (early/mid/late redemption fees: 0-3% based on timing)
  - **Volume restrictions** (minimum redemption percentages, annual caps, quarterly gates)
  - **Market conditions** (stress deferrals, valuation thresholds)
- **Multi-source data reconciliation**: Investment records, fund documents, investor profiles, and historical redemption patterns
- **Human error risk**: Manual cross-referencing of complex rules increases oversight probability

### The Solution
This AI-powered system transforms redemption analysis from hours to minutes by:
- **Intelligent investment discovery**: Guides users to identify investments eligible for redemption
- **Document-driven analysis**: Retrieves and processes actual fund documents with redemption criteria
- **Automated eligibility verification**: AI agent analyzes fund documents and applies redemption rules contextually
- **Structured decision support**: Provides detailed reasoning and recommendations for redemption requests

### Value Proposition
- **Time savings**: Reduces analysis time from hours to minutes per request
- **Accuracy improvement**: Eliminates human error through systematic rule application
- **Scalability**: Handles high-volume redemption processing efficiently
- **Compliance assurance**: Ensures all fund document requirements are properly evaluated

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview
This application combines a modern React frontend with an AI-powered backend leveraging the latest LLM models on Amazon Bedrock and hosted on AgentCore (still in preview).

### Architecture Components

   - System: Returns list of all investors named Susan with IDs and details

2. **Investor Selection & Fund Discovery**
   - User: Selects specific Susan (e.g., "Susan Johnson, ID: CA_1234")
   - System: Queries database and returns list of all funds Susan has invested in

3. **Fund Selection & Document Analysis**
   - User: Selects target fund (e.g., "Strategic Growth Fund 1")
   - System: Automatically retrieves fund document for Susan's investor class
   - System: Displays Susan's specific investments in that fund

4. **Investment Analysis & Redemption Eligibility**
   - User: Selects specific investment to redeem
   - System: Cross-references investment data with fund document rules
   - System: Analyzes holding periods, notice requirements, fees, and restrictions
   - System: Provides detailed eligibility assessment with supporting reasons

5. **Redemption Processing**
   - If eligible: System asks "Would you like to process this redemption request?"
   - If ineligible: System explains specific reasons and requirements not met
   - User: Confirms to initiate redemption or requests alternative analysis

This guided workflow ensures comprehensive analysis while maintaining audit trails and regulatory compliance.
