INVESTOR CLASSIFICATION

Institutional investors represent large institutional investors, pension funds, and endowments with investment commitments typically ranging from $10,000,000 to $50,000,000. This investor class receives specific terms and conditions as outlined in this document, reflecting their investment size and relationship with the Fund.

CAPITAL COMMITMENT AND DRAWDOWN

Investors in Institutional are required to make binding capital commitments which will be drawn down over the investment period as investment opportunities are identified and evaluated. Capital calls will be made with a minimum of 20 business days' notice, and investors are expected to fund their commitments promptly to avoid default provisions and related penalties.

REDEMPTION AND LIQUIDITY PROVISIONS

The Fund provides redemption rights to Institutional investors subject to the following comprehensive terms and conditions designed to balance investor liquidity needs with the Fund's long-term investment strategy:

Minimum Holding Period: Each investment made by an investor must be held for a minimum period of 30 months from the date of the capital call funding that investment. No redemption requests will be considered for investments that have not satisfied this minimum holding requirement, except in cases of documented financial hardship as determined by the General Partner.

Redemption Windows: Redemption requests may only be submitted during quarterly redemption windows ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. Investors must provide written notice of their redemption request no less than 45 days prior to the desired redemption date.

Investment Period Restrictions: During the Fund's initial investment period, which extends for the first 3 years following the Fund's initial closing, redemptions are subject to additional restrictions and General Partner approval to ensure adequate capital remains available for new investments.

Minimum Redemption Amounts: Any redemption request must be for at least 20 percent of the value of a specific investment. Partial redemptions below this threshold will not be accepted to maintain operational efficiency. Investors may request redemption of multiple investments simultaneously, provided each meets the minimum threshold.

Annual Redemption Limits: Institutional investors may not redeem more than 30 percent of their total committed capital in any twelve-month period, calculated on a rolling basis to prevent excessive portfolio turnover.

Gate Provisions: The Fund reserves the right to limit total redemptions in any quarter to no more than 10 percent of the Fund's net asset value. If redemption requests exceed this threshold, requests will be honored on a pro-rata basis with remaining requests carried forward to subsequent quarters.

REDEMPTION FEES AND COSTS

To align investor interests with the Fund's long-term investment strategy and compensate for transaction costs, redemption fees apply as follows: investments redeemed within the first two years are subject to a 2 percent fee; investments redeemed in years three and four are subject to a 1 percent fee; and investments held for five years or more are subject to a 0 percent fee. All redemption fees are payable to the Fund.

VALUATION AND PROCESSING

Redemptions will be valued based on the most recent quarterly net asset value as determined by the Fund's independent valuation firm using industry-standard methodologies. For redemption requests exceeding $5,000,000, an independent third-party valuation may be required. Redemption proceeds will be distributed within 14 days of the redemption date, subject to any applicable gate provisions or other restrictions.

SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

The General Partner reserves the right to suspend or defer redemption requests during periods of market stress, pending litigation that may materially affect Fund assets, regulatory investigations, or other circumstances that may not be in the best interests of the Fund or its remaining investors. All redemptions will be processed on a first-in, first-out basis with respect to the investor's investment history unless otherwise specified.

Additional restrictions may apply during the final two years of the Fund term to ensure orderly liquidation of portfolio investments. The Fund may also restrict redemptions if such redemptions would cause the Fund to fall below minimum regulatory capital requirements or violate debt covenants.

REPORTING AND COMMUNICATION

Institutional investors will receive quarterly financial statements, annual audited reports, and periodic updates on portfolio company performance. Additional reporting may be available upon request, subject to confidentiality restrictions and General Partner approval.

This Term Sheet is effective as of January 1, 2020, and was last updated on July 21, 2025. These terms are subject to the definitive Limited Partnership Agreement and related Fund documents, which shall govern in case of any conflicts.
