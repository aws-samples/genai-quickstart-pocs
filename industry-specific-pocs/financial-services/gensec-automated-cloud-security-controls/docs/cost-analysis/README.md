## Key Findings (Final - Claude 4)

- **Cost per successful execution**: $3.61 (Claude 4)
- **Effective cost per attempt**: $9.03 (due to 40% success rate)
- **Primary optimization**: Improve success rate from 40% to 80%
- **Potential savings**: 50% cost reduction through reliability improvements

## Optimization Strategy

**Keeping Claude 4** for superior AI capabilities:
1. **Phase 1**: Improve success rate to 60% → $6.02 per attempt
2. **Phase 2**: Improve success rate to 80% → $4.52 per attempt  
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize to 85% → $4.25 per attempt

**Target**: $4.52 per attempt (50% savings) while maintaining Claude 4's advanced security analysis capabilities.
