# Stomach Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Stomach Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the stomach lining. Gastric cancer is characterized by its variable presentation, aggressive nature, and often late diagnosis. While incidence rates have declined in many developed countries, it remains a significant global health concern, particularly in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South and Central America.

### Classification Systems

**Anatomical Location**:
- **Proximal/Cardia**: Upper third of stomach, including the gastroesophageal junction
- **Corpus/Body**: Middle third of stomach
- **Antrum/Distal**: Lower third of stomach, adjacent to the pylorus
- **Diffuse/Linitis Plastica**: Involving a large portion of the stomach, often with thickened, rigid walls

**Histological Types**:
- **Adenocarcinoma** (>90% of gastric cancers):
  - **Intestinal type**: Well-differentiated, glandular structures, better prognosis, more common in older males
  - **Diffuse type**: Poorly-differentiated, signet ring cells, worse prognosis, more common in younger patients and females
  - **Mixed type**: Features of both intestinal and diffuse types
  - **Indeterminate type**: Cannot be classified as intestinal or diffuse

- **Other Histological Types** (<10% of gastric cancers):
  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)
  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)
  - Lymphomas (MALT lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma)
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Leiomyosarcoma
  - Metastases from other primary sites

**Lauren Classification** (for adenocarcinoma):
- **Intestinal type**: Well-defined glands, cohesive cells, better prognosis
- **Diffuse type**: Infiltrative growth, non-cohesive cells, worse prognosis
- **Mixed type**: Features of both intestinal and diffuse patterns
- **Indeterminate type**: Cannot be classified into the above categories

**WHO Classification** (2019):
- Papillary adenocarcinoma
- Tubular adenocarcinoma
- Mucinous adenocarcinoma
- Poorly cohesive carcinoma (including signet ring cell carcinoma)
- Mixed carcinoma
- Adenosquamous carcinoma
- Carcinoma with lymphoid stroma (medullary carcinoma)
- Hepatoid adenocarcinoma
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Undifferentiated carcinoma
- Neuroendocrine neoplasms
