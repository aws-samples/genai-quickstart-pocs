    "## Executive Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution from foundation models to agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enterprise software development. While building AI agent prototypes has become increasingly accessible through open-source frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex, the journey from proof-of-concept to production-ready systems presents significant architectural and operational challenges. This framework addresses the critical gap between prototype development and enterprise-scale deployment through six fundamental primitives that collectively enable secure, scalable, and maintainable agentic AI systems.\n",
