# Principles for building Multi-Agents
Principle #1: Do not force-fit workloads  into a collaboration pattern.
Identify decision frictions and then design workflows around the proper pattern.

Principle #2: Share Context
For effective interaction, provide the full context and complete history of agent interactions, rather than isolating individual messages. 

Principle #3: Recognize Action-Decision Relationships
Every action reflects an underlying decision. When multiple actions stem from contradictory decisions, negative outcomes are likely to occur. Avoid semantic ambiguity and conflicting actions

Principle #4: Desing for enterprise productivity (not just individual task augmentation)
Use Agentic systems when decision and automation are needed 


In this folder we will provide Jupyter Notebook examples on how to get started with different Strands Agents functionalities.

## FSI Use Cases
Autonomous Claims Adjudication: An agent that receives an insurance claim, retrieves policy details, validates information against external sources (e.g., repair shop estimates), and approves or flags the claim for human review.
Pattern —> Swarm with Sequential process
Applied Principle  Example --> Principle 1

Automated Financial Research & Analysis: An agent that can ingest a financial report,news and analyzes market data from multiple sources, another agent perform evaluates risks or other metrics, and an editorial agent generate a summary report with key insights.
Pattern —> Mesh
Applied Principle  Example --> Principle 2


Intelligent Application (Loan, Insurance) Processing: An agent that orchestrates the entire  origination process, from validating customer information across different systems to running validation checks via API and scheduling tasks for human review.
Pattern —> Hierarchical
Applied Principle  Example --> Principle 3

Customer Service Concierge: A customer-facing agent that can handle complex requests like "My card was declined at a store, can you tell me why and help me fix it?" by checking transaction systems, fraud alerts, and account balances, then offering and executing a solution
Pattern —> Star Topology
Applied Principle  Example --> Principle 4
