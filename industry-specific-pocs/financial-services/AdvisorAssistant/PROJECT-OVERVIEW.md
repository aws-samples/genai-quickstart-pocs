## Architecture

```
Users → Load Balancer → ECS Fargate → DynamoDB
                           ↓
                    AWS Bedrock (Claude)
                           ↓
                    S3 + SNS + SQS
```

## Core Components

- **ECS Fargate** - Containerized Node.js app
- **DynamoDB** - Companies, earnings, analyses, alerts
- **AWS Bedrock** - Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI analysis
- **S3** - Document storage
- **Cognito** - User authentication
- **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logs

## AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ECS Fargate | Containerized application hosting |
| Application Load Balancer | Traffic distribution |
| NAT Gateway | Outbound internet access |
| DynamoDB | NoSQL data storage |
| Other Services | S3, Cognito, Bedrock, CloudWatch |

## Deployment

```bash
./deploy.sh poc us-east-1 YOUR_API_KEY
```

- Takes 10-15 minutes
- Creates complete infrastructure
- Deploys application
- Ready to use

## Security Features Implemented

- **Network Isolation** - VPC with private subnets for application containers
- **Data Encryption** - DynamoDB and S3 encryption at rest using AWS managed keys
- **Authentication** - AWS Cognito User Pools for user management
- **Access Control** - IAM roles and policies with least privilege principles
- **Audit Logging** - CloudWatch logs for monitoring and audit trails

**Note**: This is a POC deployment with HTTP endpoints. HTTPS would require additional SSL/TLS certificate configuration.

## Performance

- **Response Time** - <500ms API calls
- **Throughput** - 100+ concurrent users
- **AI Analysis** - 2-5 seconds per report
- **Availability** - 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability** - Auto-scaling ECS tasks

## Use Cases

### Financial Analyst Workflow

1. Add companies to track (AAPL, TSLA, etc.)
2. System fetches latest earnings automatically
3. AI analyzes performance vs estimates
4. Receive alerts for significant events
5. Review trends and insights

### Demo Scenarios

1. **Real-time Analysis** - Add AAPL, show AI insights
2. **Multi-user** - Different users, different watchlists
3. **Alert System** - Demonstrate automated notifications
4. **Historical Trends** - Show quarter-over-quarter analysis
