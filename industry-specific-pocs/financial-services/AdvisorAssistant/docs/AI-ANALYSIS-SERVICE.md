```javascript
// Example of data validation process
const comprehensiveData = {
  companyInfo: {
    name: "Apple Inc.",
    sector: "Technology",
    marketCap: 3000000000000,
    peRatio: 28.5,
    // ... other fundamentals
  },
  currentPrice: {
    price: 185.50,
    change: 2.30,
    changePercent: 0.0125,
    volume: 45000000
  },
  sentiment: {
    score: 0.65,
    label: "positive",
    newsCount: 15,
    confidence: 0.8
  },
  macroContext: {
    fedRate: 5.25,
    cpi: 307.2,
    inflationRate: 3.2
  }
};
```

## AI Analysis Engine

- Technical analysis indicators

### 2. AI Model Configuration

#### Model Selection
- **Primary Model**: `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 tokens for comprehensive analysis
- **Temperature**: 0.1 for consistent, analytical responses

### 3. Response Processing

The AI generates structured JSON responses containing:

#### Investment Recommendation
```json
{
  "recommendation": "BUY",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "targetPrice": 200.00,
  "timeHorizon": "12-18 months",
  "positionSize": "2-3% of portfolio",
  "reasoning": "Strong fundamentals with attractive valuation..."
}
```

#### Risk Assessment
```json
{
  "overallRisk": "MODERATE",
  "riskFactors": [
    {
      "factor": "Market Concentration",
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "description": "High dependence on iPhone sales"
    }
  ],
  "riskMitigation": "Diversify across multiple tech positions"
}
```

#### Valuation Analysis

    "peVsPeers": "PREMIUM",
    "pegRatio": "ATTRACTIVE",
    "priceToBook": "REASONABLE"
  }
}
```

## Caching and Performance Optimization

### 1. Multi-Level Caching Strategy

#### In-Memory Cache
- **Purpose**: Immediate access to recent analyses
- **Duration**: Session-based, cleared on service restart
- **Key Format**: `{ticker}-{quarter}-{year}`

#### Database Cache
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage of completed analyses
- **Duration**: Permanent with timestamp tracking
- **Table**: `analyses` in DynamoDB

#### Processing Locks
- **Purpose**: Prevent duplicate concurrent analyses
- **Implementation**: Set-based tracking of active analyses
- **Timeout**: 30 minutes maximum per analysis

### 2. Cost Optimization

#### Cache-First Strategy
1. Check in-memory cache
2. Check database cache
3. Only call AI if no cached result exists

#### Intelligent Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff to minimize wasted API calls
- Throttling detection and appropriate wait times
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

#### Request Batching
- Process multiple earnings reports efficiently
- Shared data gathering for related analyses
- Optimized prompt construction to maximize token usage

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Error Classification

#### Authentication Errors
- **Category**: `auth`
- **Severity**: `critical`
- **Action**: Disable provider, alert administrators

#### Rate Limiting Errors
- **Category**: `rate_limit`
- **Severity**: `high`
- **Action**: Exponential backoff, queue requests

#### Timeout Errors
- **Category**: `timeout`
- **Severity**: `medium`
- **Action**: Retry with longer timeout

#### Data Errors
- **Category**: `data`
- **Severity**: `medium`
- **Action**: Use partial data, log for investigation

### 2. Graceful Degradation

#### Partial Data Analysis
- Continue analysis with available data sources
- Clearly indicate data limitations in results
- Provide confidence scores based on data completeness

#### Fallback Strategies
- Use cached analysis if AI fails
- Provide basic financial metrics without AI insights
- Queue failed analyses for retry during off-peak hours

#### User Communication
- Clear error messages explaining limitations
- Suggested retry times for temporary failures
- Alternative data sources when primary fails
