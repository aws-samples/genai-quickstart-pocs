## 15-Minute Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with Bedrock access enabled
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet model access** - Must be enabled in AWS Bedrock console (see setup instructions below)

- Docker installed and running
- **Note**: This POC deploys with HTTP endpoints. HTTPS implementation would need to be configured separately for production use
- Optional: API keys for enhanced functionality
  - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) - Free tier available
  - [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/) - Free access available

#### Enable Claude 3.5 Sonnet Model Access
Before deployment, you must enable Claude 3.5 Sonnet access in the AWS Bedrock console:

1. **Open AWS Bedrock Console**: Navigate to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
2. **Go to Model Access**: In the left navigation, under "Bedrock configurations", choose "Model access"
3. **Modify Model Access**: Click "Modify model access" button
4. **Select Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Find and check the box for "Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
5. **Submit Use Case**: For Anthropic models, you'll need to describe your use case
6. **Review and Submit**: Review terms and submit your request

**Note**: Model access approval is typically instant for most use cases. Once approved, the model is available for all users in your AWS account.

### Deploy Now
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd advisor-assistant-poc

# Deploy with full functionality (recommended)
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key FRED_API_KEY=your_key ./deploy-with-tests.sh poc us-east-1

# Or deploy with basic functionality
./deploy-with-tests.sh poc us-east-1
```

**What happens during deployment:**
- ✅ Security foundation (VPC, encryption, authentication)
- ✅ Application infrastructure (containers, database, load balancer)
- ✅ AI integration (AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- ✅ Monitoring and logging setup
- ✅ Health checks and validation

**Access your platform:** The deployment script will output your application URL
