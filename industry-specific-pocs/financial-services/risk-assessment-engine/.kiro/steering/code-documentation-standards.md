# Code Documentation Standards

## Code Commenting Guidelines

### Function and Method Comments
- Every public function/method must have a docstring or comment block explaining:
  - Purpose and functionality
  - Parameters and their types
  - Return values and types
  - Any exceptions that may be thrown
  - Usage examples for complex functions

### Inline Comments
- Use inline comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, or business rules
- Comment the "why" not the "what" - explain reasoning behind non-obvious code
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for temporary code or future improvements

### Class and Module Comments
- Every class should have a header comment explaining its purpose and responsibilities
- Module-level comments should describe the overall functionality and key exports
- Include author information and creation/modification dates where appropriate

## README File Requirements

### Project README Structure
Every project must include a README.md with the following sections:

1. **Project Title and Description**
   - Clear, concise description of what the application does
   - Key features and capabilities

2. **Installation and Setup**
   - Prerequisites and dependencies
   - Step-by-step installation instructions
   - Environment setup requirements

3. **Usage Instructions**
   - Basic usage examples
   - Configuration options
   - API documentation links if applicable

4. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level system architecture
   - Key components and their interactions
   - Technology stack and frameworks used

5. **Development Guidelines**
   - How to contribute to the project
   - Coding standards and conventions
   - Testing procedures

6. **Dependencies**
   - List of key dependencies and their purposes
   - Version requirements
   - License information

### Module/Component READMEs
For complex modules or components, include focused README files that cover:
- Specific functionality and purpose
- Integration points with other components
- Configuration and customization options
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Documentation Maintenance
- Update documentation when code functionality changes
- Review and refresh README files during major releases
- Ensure all examples in documentation are tested and working
- Keep dependency lists current and accurate
