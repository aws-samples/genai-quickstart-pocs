- **Component interaction patterns** and data flow
- **Deployment architecture** showing how components are distributed across AWS services
- **Scalability considerations** and auto-scaling strategies

#### 2. Technical Design Details

##### Data Architecture
- **Database design** with schema definitions for both DynamoDB and PostgreSQL
- **Data models** with relationships and constraints

### Design Quality Standards

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Clear diagrams** using Mermaid or similar tools where appropriate
- **Code examples** for complex implementations
- **Configuration samples** for deployment and setup
- **Decision rationale** explaining architectural choices

#### Consistency Requirements
- **Naming conventions** aligned with Python PEP 8 standards

#### Performance Considerations
- **Response time** requirements and optimization strategies
- **Scalability** patterns and auto-scaling triggers
- **Resource utilization** optimization for cost-effectiveness
- **Caching strategies** for improved performance

### Integration with Steering Standards

The design must align with all established steering standards:
- **Tech Stack Standards** - Use AWS AgentCore services and specified technologies
- **Agent-First Architecture** - Prioritize AgentCore Runtime for AI agent workloads

- **Git Workflow Rules** - Consider branching and deployment strategies

### Design Review Criteria

Before proceeding to implementation tasks, ensure the design addresses:
- All functional and technical requirements from the requirements document
- Scalability and performance requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- Integration with external systems
- Testing and quality assurance strategies
- Deployment and operational considerations
