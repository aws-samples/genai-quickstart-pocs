# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This application provides real-time evaluation of customer comprehensive risk profiles by analyzing Risk Tolerance and Risk Capacity through three integrated dimensions: behavioral metrics, psychological indicators, and sentiment & communications analysis. 

The system leverages **agentic AI capabilities powered by AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Strands, and MCP servers** to deliver intelligent, explainable, and adaptive risk assessment capabilities that surpass traditional rule-based systems. Specialized agents collaborate through AWS Bedrock AgentCore orchestration, utilizing foundation models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Amazon Nova for cost-effective, high-quality analysis.

Key capabilities include:
- **Multi-agent collaboration** for comprehensive risk analysis
- **Natural language explanations** tailored to different audiences  
- **Predictive analytics** with proactive risk change forecasting
- **Interactive conversations** for detailed assessment exploration
- **Real-time transparency** of AI reasoning and decision-making processes

### Risk Assessment Requirements

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Risk Assessment

**User Story:** As a risk analyst, I want the system to evaluate both risk tolerance and risk capacity with real-time updates, so that I can understand the customer's complete risk profile and receive timely alerts for significant changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
