# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This application will provide real-time evaluation of an individual's comprehensive risk profile by analyzing both Risk Tolerance and Risk Capacity through 1/ observed behavioral metrics, 2/ psychological indicators and 3/ sentiment and communications analysis. The system will continuously monitor and assess customer behavior and psychological patterns to dynamically update risk assessments, moving beyond static questionnaires to provide accurate, behavior-driven risk profiling for financial decision-making.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a financial professional, I want the system to evaluate risk tolerance based on the three analysis dimensions, so that I can understand the customer's psychological comfort with financial risk.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time comprehensive risk profile updates, so that I can make informed decisions based on current multi-dimensional customer risk assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any of the three analysis dimensions show significant changes THEN the system SHALL update the comprehensive risk profile in real-time
2. WHEN risk assessment is updated THEN the system SHALL provide both risk tolerance and risk capacity scores with confidence levels and trend indicators
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include detailed explanations of behavioral, psychological, and sentiment factors contributing to the assessment
