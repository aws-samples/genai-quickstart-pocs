### Communication Protocol
- **Daily standups**: 9:00 AM to coordinate dependencies
- **Shared Slack channel**: For real-time coordination
- **Weekly demos**: Friday afternoon to review progress
- **Code reviews**: All PRs require review from the other engineer

This parallel development approach allows both engineers to work independently while maintaining clear integration points and shared deliverables.
