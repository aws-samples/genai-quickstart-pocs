Petroleum engineers spend a lot of their time reading well reports. In this demo I'll show how you can make that process much more efficient.

Here we have a sample set of pdf documents from the state of New Mexico's website about a certain well in the San Juan basin.

Now say this well developed a hole in tubing. Traditionally, I'd have to go read all of these documents and take notes to understand what happened in the past on this well. That can take a lot of time and it can be quite tedious.

Instead of doing that, I can let an AI agent read all these PDFs for me, then summarize their information and plot the well's production with these events. That way I can quickly get the context I need to write a procedure and fix this well.

Here is a demo of that happening. This is a chat with the AI agent. I've asked it to make a table with detailed information about all of the events.

Here is the table that the AI agent automatically produced. So no human was involved in creating this table, it was just the AI.

I can quickly read through it in order to learn about what happened in the past on this well. So I can see when it was drilled, that it was stimulated, re-stimulated, the tubing was replaced, and they even plan a workover for the future.

Now if I want to learn more about any of these events, I have a list to the source document that the generative AI agent read in order to come up with this line of the table.

So say I want to learn more about the tubing replacement, well I can click the link to the source document and then go look at that pdf that it read in order to generate this information.

So here I can see the activity from that operation, how they moved in, rigged up, shut down for the weekend, and all the other operational events that are recorded in this document.

So I can be confident that a generative AI agent is giving me an accurate representation of an operational event. In this way, I can much more quickly learn about the history of a well and know what to look into more if I want to know more information.

This can make the job of a petroleum engineer a lot more efficient. And if this is exciting to you, talk to your AWS account team about how you can leverage generative AI to make your business better. Thanks, this was Walt Mayfield, software architect at AWS.
