# Agents4Energy Dependency and Build Configuration

## Identified Issues

1. **Node.js Version Incompatibility**
   - Some packages require Node.js v20+ or v22+
   - Build environment was using Node.js v18.20.6
   - Affected packages: path-scurry@2.0.0, minimatch@10.0.1

2. **Missing Build Script**
   - The build process was trying to run `npm run build:backend`
   - This script doesn't exist in package.json

3. **Package Access Issues**
   - 403 Forbidden errors when trying to download npm packages
   - Specifically for camelcase@6.3.0 and camel-case@4.1.2

4. **AWS Amplify Deprecation Warnings**
   - Multiple @aws-amplify/* packages showed deprecation warnings
   - Message: "backend-cli 1.6.0 does not work with Amplify Hosting service"

## Applied Solutions

1. **Build Configuration Alignment**
   - Synchronized package.json and amplify.yml with main branch
   - Using standard Amplify build configuration with npm ci
   - Removed custom build:backend script

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Using npm ci with cache for faster, more reliable builds
   - Using --prefer-offline flag to prioritize cached packages
   - Properly configured cache paths for node_modules and .npm

## Best Practices for Dependency Management

1. **Version Pinning**
   - Use exact versions for critical dependencies
   - Consider using package locks for consistent installations

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm update` to keep dependencies current
   - Consider automated dependency updates with tools like Dependabot

3. **Build Environment Consistency**
   - Use `.nvmrc` or similar to specify Node.js version
   - Document environment requirements in README
   - Consider containerization for complete environment control

4. **Amplify-Specific Recommendations**
   - Keep Amplify CLI versions aligned with Amplify Hosting requirements
   - Test locally before deploying to catch compatibility issues
   - Review Amplify documentation for version compatibility guidance
